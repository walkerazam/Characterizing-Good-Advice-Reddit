I enjoy my job duties and the people I work with, but lately the pay has not been great. An amazing opportunity presented itself in my area and I used my indeed profile to apply for the job, so I updated my resume. On top of that, the job also lines up with my college major (which means possibility for advancement once I graduate, hopefully).

Is there some dude in the Bay Area who‚Äôs renting himself out as a candidate to scam employers into hiring random people in India? Where is the guy who interviewed and was qualified for this job? I‚Äôm very interested to know what happens.   OP I agree with the others. Say something to HR as soon as possible. His lack of skills, and unwillingness to be on camera are enough to trigger red flags.",25,False,
88,sm19xn,hvumze5,"First things first, I think you have handled the situation well so far. Not discussing the matter with others except HR/Management is the correct approach. Note down what you saw and when you saw them so that if HR asks, you have details on hand. Ultimately this should be an HR investigation (you wouldn't be involved beyond what is necessary). I would approach HR exactly as you have stated here. You are new to the company, but something about this just feels wrong and you'd like a safe space to talk through your suspicions in case they have special ramifications for the company.  We had this happen at a company I worked for and IT was able to ping their laptop's location and it wasn't anywhere near where it should have been (Mortgage industry is REALLY strict about licensing distances, etc.). That, combined with other manager's interviews/interactions with the individual led us to confirm the person working for us was not located in the US, which is a huge breach of licensing guidelines. We set up a meeting to terminate immediately and the guy never showed. Never heard from him again and we took a loss on the work laptop we sent him.",16,False,
89,sm19xn,hvuhkff,I once heard about a guy who was hired as a coder or something for a company.  What he did was hire on some other guy in India who did the work and he passed it off as his own.  Apparently the work was really good and no one suspected until he messed up one day and was found out.  Sounds like the same thing.  The guy you hired has likely contracted someone in India to do their work for them at a reduced rate and is pocketing the difference.  Sounds like a clear case of fraud so take it to HR for investigation,14,False,
90,sm19xn,hvucpj1,"This isn't your fault, but it WILL be if you don't talk to HR about it and ask for their advice and support.  Soon, like tomorrow.  They'll know what to do and if you're in a large enough company, have probably dealt with something similar before.",20,False,

92,sm19xn,hvu6ltp,"Just here to say what others have said - bring this up ASAP and get it taken care of. It‚Äôs kind of bizarre and that may be part of why you are hesitant or in disbelief; others may be thinking the same thing you are but may not know how to broach the subject.   You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. This is a weird situation that could happen to anyone, just make sure you deal with it ASAP.  Good luck!",14,False,
93,sm19xn,hvulgh9,"Your HR department would have filled out an I-9 for him on his first day of employment. This is the form that verifies he is allowed to work in the US. The HR folks have to see a photo ID in order to fill out the form, and verify it's the same person. They do this process even if it's a remote hire, it is federal law.  Check with the HR department. Either they forgot to do the I-9 (in which case they will need to do it right away) or he showed a fake ID for a different person, and they should have noticed.",17,False,

95,sm19xn,hvud6s8,"It's impressive how sinister and calculated this scam would be. If the person does great then you never notice and he gets a good job. If he does shit you end up paying him for as long as he can keep the front up, which could still ultimately be thousands of dollars until the situation is resolved. In the end, even if the authorities did get involved (unlikely) they probably wouldn't be able to locate or extradite this anonymous person in a different country. If he does get fired they probably turn around and do it again.  Kind of reminds me of my time recruiting in a call center. There was always a fear in my company that people would get hired just to do the training, quit before doing any real work, and then just do it again at a different call center.",8,False,
96,sm19xn,hvvrc0w,"I'm not officially HR, but due to our HR being pretty terrible at interviewing I've stepped in.  I'm one of the engineers but I can perform both the technical and personality checks in the interviews.  They usually consider my feedback well, especially after hiring a bunch of people that I red flagged.     We've had a few of these kind of hires. We hire a lot of people out of India and this is absolutely a thing. Just like some of the college testing fraud, there are interview stand-ins.  Usually the difference in their English skills gives them away and then in their technical skills.       You are going to want to bring this up.  Carefully email HR and your boss.  Leave the recruiter out of this for the moment.  You will want to make an internal decision before you get the recruiter involved.     However, our parent company has hard rules around locality pay.  East Coast vs West Coast in the same country is never a big deal, but if this guy was claiming the US payrate but actually located in India, that's when he'd not only get fired, but the situation would leave our hands and head up the to the legal team with the parent company.  Since his work is still butt, he's probably not even outsourcing his work with the excess income.     It's also potentially a security risk depending on your field.  I saw new NDAs every few weeks for my job.  A fraudulent hire is a big. big no-no risk, especially if he does end up outsourcing his work.",3,False,

This is definitely a thing in India, and we've been seeing it more and more in the IT and data science fields in the US for the last several years, primarily with Indian hires.   The situation you're describing is a little more extreme than most I've heard of in the US, but it wouldn't surprise me. You should loop in your boss and your HR and legal departments about your suspicions immediately.",1,False,

I also look at their IP address from the virtual call - i can tell by their email address that they are in  India.  I've become extra paranoid, a stalker and untrusting - my clients have also put in taps in place.  We are constantly updating our practices  to keep up with bait and switches.

108,sm19xn,hznpbnu,"This is long but check it out.   As an Indian‚Ä¶ in IT, this is actually very common, I have gotten calls where companies will make you a whole resume, take the calls‚Ä¶ and when it‚Äôs a video call, they will answer the question while the candidate just lip syncs.   But the candidate does get ‚Äútrained‚Äù like for a month-ish like they basically will make you pay for a class and learn the basics about the position you are supposed to do‚Ä¶  A lot of these people who do this are Indians who are trying to stay here or came from India and have no experience, or even a degree.   I GUARANTEE you if you are in IT and are surrounded by Indian colleagues 1 out of 5 (making up this number) got into their position this way. I am in a midst of a job search, and since I have an Indian name, I get these calls daily‚Ä¶ and since a lot of IT jobs are contracts, they make you sign like exclusivity forms so you can‚Äôt work with any other recruiters ‚Ä¶ the company who ‚Äútrains‚Äù this guy is going through another vendor who than works with the client. Then The company will say they will help you with the job whenever you need it but after a few months they make you pay for any more help you need‚Ä¶   I was going through a background check and they asked for my last education history‚Ä¶ so I guess they even check that now too‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm telling you this background check is intense and I‚Äôm worried even though I don‚Äôt have to be, they call and verify every single prior work you put on it‚Ä¶ these Indian agencies will use companies where they have friends working and then use the friend as the reference (and give that guy a few hundred for doing the reference)‚Ä¶ Most Indian consultancy make their money this way‚Ä¶ also on your resume it‚Äôll say you have like 10 years of experience when you have none, so that they can get you a top paying job, and then obviously the vendor who directly work with the client take their cut and than the Indian consultancy takes a cut, but like say you are making 100,000 the first consultancy (the Indian one) will take about im not sure but someone I know who did this route , said they get like 70k. (I‚Äôm making a number). So basically yes the first consultancy is doing some work (maybe) to get you a job, but than they are getting 30k while the other dude tries to figure out what the eff he or she is doing‚Ä¶ this might be discrimination towards my own people, but when I get a call from a John Miller and he sounds Indian as f**k. I tell them straight up, this is what I‚Äôm looking for, no I won‚Äôt change my resume, I won‚Äôt sign any exclusivity clause‚Ä¶ because that means I HAVE to go through this agency, but like I  just needed a job ASAP, since I was out of work for a bit, so I tell them straight up. I‚Äôm looking on my own, and working with other recruiters, if you got a problem with that you don‚Äôt need to call me again, and besides all the interviews I have gotten came from a real American consultancy rather than any of the calls I get from Indian agencies who promise you a job within weeks‚Ä¶  We all exaggerate a little let‚Äôs face it, but when I realized  this is how IT works, I was like I guess wasn‚Äôt surprised‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still waiting on one more work history verification and like that‚Äôs making me anxious‚Ä¶ my supervisor is really bad at calling/texting/emailing‚Ä¶.

Anyways, don‚Äôt feel bad about it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs def a thing‚Ä¶I have a high voice for a dude anyways, so I like being rude to them, so I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI get mistaken for a woman all the time, you‚Äôre voice is like realll deep with an accent‚Äù like I‚Äôm US born and raised, like how do you not get suspicious about that‚Ä¶  The funny part is when I have had interviews and it‚Äôs with someone Indian they will try to like find a way to make you slip up, because they know how it works or did it themselves‚Ä¶ like I don‚Äôt know if I have the confidence to do a job that I‚Äôm qualified for‚Ä¶ imagine going into a job with being in a ‚ÄúSenior Level‚Äù role? I would need a Xanax every five minutes.  And to add what some of what you are all saying, I‚Äôve been getting calls at 7pm because that probably like during the day in India, I‚Äôm like yea I can‚Äôt talk, call me during working hours, but they don‚Äôt call back.

Any further communications from this man will be ignored unless they are professional in nature. * As you do not work together on projects within the company, or even reside in the same building, this does not require any significant action on your part.  Go over the above in the HR meeting, then send them an email saying you've summarised the points you raised in the meeting, pasting the above (in your own words, of course) and sending it across to them.  Note that this hinges on whether they know you're gay, and what the company's attitude is to ""gay homewreckers"". Also depends on the positions of the man and woman at the company...are they senior managers or in any way powerful? Do you have a good enough relationship with your manager that you can ask them if they received any unusual emails regarding yourself?  It's kind of a mess, but it's better to go to HR ASAP so you can set the narrative.  I'm just mindful that they may fire you for being gay, or because the man/woman are important figures in the org. You may wish to read up on your employment rights in Texas.  Edit: and revenge porn laws in Texas. Are simple text messages considered revenge porn, or does it need to be a photo?",3,False,

Insulting you for being homosexual is legally the same as calling a person of color the n-word.  So make sure you highlight any attacks that mentioned your sexuality.  If they don't react aggressively on your side then you will have a very easy lawsuit.  Also make sure you watch and document any potential retaliation, just in case.

321,r4cgmu,hmgvkcl,"Not a lawyer or HR but I think I have a relatively decent handle on this kind of deal... I've been afraid of something like this in the past myself.  I agree with others here, you need to talk to HR and your manager (or skip level manager if you're not comfortable with talking to your direct manager). You should do it as soon as possible.  If she's sending your nudes to others without your consent (revenge porn), that is a felony in Texas. She will do more than just lose her job, which she absolutely should (as in should, but does not have to, as long as the problem is remediated by the employer's chosen solution - which cannot include firing you or denying you opportunities). This has become harassment in the workplace and the employer has a responsibility to stop it. If she hadn't done this it would be a bit of gray area, but she has been so kind as to remove that barrier.  However, your employer only has the responsibility (and indeed, power) to stop her from affecting your work life. If she continues to harass you, you have several options, but you should get in contact with a lawyer as soon as possible, because even if your HR department and manager have scruples, that does not mean a future employer will if she pulls the same thing.  Your options outside of work are:  1. Ignore it, which I don't recommend (you could seek recompense for damage to your reputation later, but obviously you can't change someone's mind easily, especially if she lies and makes it worse than it is) 2. File a civil suit against her seeking recompense for emotional harm (not likely to be awarded in any large part), defamation (probably only awarded after the damage is done), and likely slander (but probably not libel). You are very unlikely to win a civil suit until she causes harm. 3. File a police report and ask the prosecutor to press charges against her. She will get charged with harassment and probably revenge porn if they do press charges, but they don't have to, especially if they don't think they'll win (i.e. lack of evidence) or don't want to. If convicted, she'll have a felony, up to 2 years in state jail, and a fine of up to $10K. 4. Both 2 and 3. Preferably do 3 first.

Unless your friend gave you some turquoise cock-shaped earrings, that is bullshit reasoning.    You have to decide, though, if you want to drag this issue through the courts, because that's about the only remedy you'll find, and frankly, if you do, you will not be employed there for very long.   This employer has already demonstrated their basic lack of understanding when it comes to employment law.    I don't have any good advice for a path forward, it's up you.

I'm conscious that some people have mental health accommodations that leverage the ADA to allow them to adjust their work schedule to allow them to work longer days and take more PTO.  And it sounds like you don't want him to leave the company, and that even with him taking more than 9 weeks leave, he still adds more value to the organisation than he costs.  You have a couple of options, all of which will have a MAJOR potential impact on your team.    1. Work with HR and your leadership - Change the unlimited PTO policy for everyone to a limited PTO policy. You may have a riot and mass exodus on your hands if you do this without compensating people with additional PTO (e.g. 4 weeks for everyone, plus 1 week per previous year of service, with the ability to roll over) with potentially a few lawsuits thrown in for good measure. And hell, even if you did compensate people for their years of service, you may still have a mass exodus.  I would not recommend this, but it is an option.    2. Assuming he has an employment contract - check the terms of his contract with a fine tooth comb and identify the slightest violation. Put him on a PIP that includes him delivering on par with the rest of the team - be really clear about what metrics he is required to deliver and how you will measure and quantify them. If the standards are high enough but still achievable, he will not be able to meet them without limiting his PTO this year.   If he meets them, look into moving him into another team that he's a better fit for.  This is probably going to alienate him from you (but frankly, it sounds like your relationship is pretty strained as it is), but may keep him in the organisation, and if not, provides cause for termination.  This will potentially have a big impact on the morale of your team, especially given that you are new to the role.    3.  Look into opportunities for him outside your team that ""better fit with his work/life balance"".  Again, this will keep him in the company, but will preserve what relationship you have with him.  Again, this may cause resentment in your team, because they will likely resent him getting what will be perceived as a promotion.    4. I'm assuming you have some kind of goal setting meeting at the beginning of the year? Set him up with a clearly actionable and measurable set of goals for the next 6 months that match what you would expect of other team members that will require him to be on seat for all but 2 weeks of the next 6 months.  Ask the your team to drop you an email if they get requests from him for help. Some requests are probably legitimate, but the ones that aren't can be used as evidence for a PIP.  Again - your team may like this guy and may feel like they are being asked to dob him in. They may take this as evidence you are not trustworthy.    5. Get to know this guy. Try and learn what's driving his PTO - is he stressed? Depressed? Anxious? You will need a huge amount of empathy to do this, and  it will take a long time to build the necessary rapport to even start addressing this. See what you can do to address the root cause of his issues. Starting the conversation with something along the lines of ""I know we didn't necessarily get off on the right foot - I apologize for that. I want to fix this and get to know you better.""

Pursuing disciplinary actions likely won't be effective. I understand wanting to express your anger/frustration but I don't think you're likely to get much more than a half-hearted apology and maybe breed some defensiveness.

I'd prefer not to worry the team, can you just let them know I will be out today and not share that I'm unwell?"" It's a crappy that you'll have to do that, but, realistically, the only thing you can do.   As for HR, they likely only care if you have COVID.

You're suffering. This is not the time for you to worry about what people think about your mystery absence. You need to take time to heal and recuperate.

I just recently retired after 40 years working various roles (30 yrs as a VP) in 6 different hospitals, working in New Orleans, Nashville, Chicago, and Seattle. So my experience about hospitals runs deep, but not so much about healthcare outside of a hospital. Let me offer some opinions based on my experience: 1. You get to decide if what you put into a job is worth what you are are getting out of a job. What you get out of a job includes salary and benefits, satisfaction with the work itself, personal relationships within the job, experience for your resume, and so forth.  2. If you envision a career where you advance through the ranks of management, there are two arenas to consider: patient care, and finance. Choose one and choose carefully, because you will stay there. If you are drawn to the patient care arena, become an RN. That is where the lions share of opportunity lies. If you are drawn to finance, get an accounting degree. These are gross generalizations, and I‚Äôm not making value judgements about the hundreds of professionals who make healthcare go round. But, for you in your situation, it‚Äôs good advice.  3. No matter how much you love your job or love your organization, it cannot love you back. That‚Äôs not meant to be cynical, and it‚Äôs OK to love your job. But remember, jobs and organizations are artificial constructs that are incapable of emotion.  4. Low and middle management jobs go to people already within the organization. Upper management jobs go to people outside of the organization.  5. Over the course of your career, there will be several major shifts that will disrupt everything you had planned. Mine were: 	- cost based reimbursement was replaced by DRGs;  	- AIDS was a new, mysterious, communicable, fatal, incurable disease. It was soon followed by MRSA.  	- the introduction of endoscopic surgery. It completely revolutionized surgery and lead to‚Ä¶ 	- the crash of inpatient LOS (length of stay), shift from inpatient to outpatient care and the boom of surgicenters.  	- the re-engineering craze 	- hospital mergers and acquisitions, and the emergence of large multi hospital systems.  	- and now, COVID.

Even if you're trying to get over it and you plan on quitting, you should report this! Who knows who'll she physically assault next, or if she's already harassing somebody else! Frankly, the company is extremely stupid for keeping such a liability but losing a non-confrontational worker, but after reading the Activision-Blizzard scandals, nothing surprises me anymore!  Her reasons for assaulting you do not matter, that's up to investigators and, if it comes to it, a court to take into consideration. The authorities can put pressure on the company to show the camera footage. Depending on your company (and state) rules, it might be permissable to film or record sound in some areas. If it is, then record (via a secret cam or a microphone/dictaphone) any further encounters with her or with any colleagues or higher-ups who've dismissed your complaints or said something malicious to you. As far as I know, even if you record in areas where recording isn't permitted, the footage itself can still be submitted into an official investigation, but I'm not an Illinois lawyer so don't quote me on that.  Her age is *also* unimportant. Nobody at any age should be going around slapping people. If their stance is ""you're older than her and you're a man, so who cares"", then that's discrimination!  It is unfortunately not uncommon for toxic workplaces to turn a blind eye to harassment and to take retaliatory measures against reporters for ""rocking the boat"". Retaliation is *also* illegal, and you can file another HR report that your co-worker or co-workers are spreading malicious gossip about you because you reported that woman. Your age, physique, gender, sexuality, skin color or *anything* about you or about your assailant should *not* matter. Anybody can be a victim, and anybody can be a perpetrator.  Leaving the company sounds like a good plan, because it seems to me that the whole workplace is toxic and discriminatory. An accuser may not be *officially* right until an offense is proven, but they should be *believed* unless proven otherwise! The fact that nobody did that in your case speaks volumes about the moral climate of that company.  Edit: to those who speculate what could have triggered the slaps -- it is not for us to come up with hypotheticals or to invalidate OP because he happens to be a man. Men can be abuse victims too, and women can be abusers. Furthermore, unless a colleague is trying to physically harass you, there is no reason to slap them. If OP had done something that she (the slapper) had a problem with, she should have gone to HR or confronted them about it without resorting to Neanderthal tactics!",1,False,
702,ovsgr8,h7dhsg6,"Bro I had a problem like that recently, a girl I worked with just decided she didn‚Äôt like me. She did everything she could to get me fired. She told on me for peeing on job sites, reported me for asking a creepy question (I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know about it if y‚Äôall ask) and she started a campaign against me like the one you are talking about.  She got fired. Like within a couple weeks. And I am not leaving anything out. I was not a creep to her. I went out of my way when I was teaching her to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to mansplain this but, [nice explanation of how to do something]‚Äù  She was just an absolute psycho. I know lots of people are commenting that you probably did something to her to warrant a response but sometimes people just pick someone that they don‚Äôt like for whatever reason and start shit with them. Lucky for me my boss knows I work my ass off and she was a terrible worker, so he fired her.  I was even nice to her AFTER she reported me. I even called after she was let go and left her a message wishing her well. Up to this point, the meanest thing I‚Äôve done is tell the truth on Reddit to a bunch of strangers. I hope that she gets help or at least realizes she‚Äôs been a shitty person upon listening to me wish her well.     Edit Ok: creepy question time  I was working with another coworker, who was friends with psycho girl. This coworker was having a tough day as her boyfriend dumped her. Now I know for a fact it doesn‚Äôt help when you tell people ‚Äúthere‚Äôs plenty of fish in the ocean‚Äù or ‚Äúyour heart will go on‚Äù or any of that cliche crap. So I elected to ask her random questions in lieu of making her more upset. I asked lots of strange questions, ‚Äúis a hotdog a sandwich? What movie would be better as a musical? What Gatorade flavor is the best?‚Äù  I prefaced one by saying ‚Äúhey this is a dark one are you cool with that?‚Äù She said yes so I asked her:  ‚ÄúHow would you torture someone if you had to?‚Äù  She didn‚Äôt flip out, she didn‚Äôt get mad, she was just really puzzled cause she never thought about it before, so I told her my method of torture.  ‚ÄúI would make someone listen to Hanson‚Äôs Mmbop on repeat‚Äù She laughed and got that I was being funny and not creepy.  She mentioned it to psycho girl in passing later on. Psycho girl left out the part about making someone listen to an annoying song. My boss was not happy, but I made him laugh when I told him my answer. Since the girl who‚Äôs boyfriend dumped her never said anything to the boss, and actually thanked me for asking her weird questions didn‚Äôt care, nothing happened. But it pissed me off because I never have had a report filed against me on a job, ever in my entire life.  Anyway, the girl who was/is friends with psycho girl is still working there and has since confirmed, psycho girl is psycho. I am not out of my mind. That‚Äôs her FRIEND from before either started working there. Some bitches be psycho.   EDIT Seriously? You‚Äôre downvoting this?   The girl‚Äôs friend who I was ACTUALLY TALKING TO said she DIDNT HAVE A PROBLEM with the question I asked. She mentioned it IN PASSING to psycho bitch. Psycho bitch took it out of context and ran to my boss. Friendly girl confirmed that psycho bitch is psycho and a bitch. And besides that psycho bitch sucked at her job, didn‚Äôt do any work, stood around watching others while everyone else put their nose to the grind. She left the company and now works at her parents business if that tells you anything.  Stop taking the psycho‚Äôs side. Mentally challenged people should not be able to fuck with my meal ticket like this. If you‚Äôre just taking her side because she‚Äôs a woman, check yourself.

781,o16he2,h20gufv,"If I might respectfully add my two cents, for better or worse:  First: this is obviously unacceptable workplace behavior for several reasons, the biggest of which is that it makes YOU uncomfortable.   Second, and bear with me please: ‚ÄúRed headed step child‚Äù is a phrase we use *absolutely all the time* (born and raised in Texas, for what little it‚Äôs worth). I‚Äôve heard that phrase applied to all manner of things, the vast majority of which are non-human. Everything from a particular grocery store to a traffic light to yard work - the phrase applies to all of it.   This is not to discount that it makes you uncomfortable. I am merely pointing out that many people use that phrase (myself included) in passing.   It seems to me that your boss was trying (and clearly struggling) to make a good impression on the client and took a stab at humorous ‚Äúone-liner‚Äù descriptions or nicknames of her people. In a pinch she came up with RHSC for you. Given the limited info here my personal read on this is that she understood either immediately or very quickly that she had misstepped with RHSC and had offended you.   At this point I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any lasting damage done, a comment in passing that included a popular turn of phrase that unexpectedly triggered someone. Apologies could have been made here and walked away clean.   Unfortunately the second half - the disarming - happened. Your boss then, knowing she fucked up even if she wasn‚Äôt 100% sure why or how much, proceeds to try to preemptively disarm your defense by pointing out to people on her terms that you were upset with her. A tactic as old as time itself used to make people second guess whether they should voice their opinion.   Sorry for the rant. To sum it up:   1) I think if someone used that phrase RHSC it is almost always done non-maliciously, they‚Äôre just using a popular turn of phrase they know.  2) whether malicious or not, it made you uncomfortable and your boss absolutely categorically should have addressed the matter with you directly and privately so she could have apologized and perhaps even sought to understand more about you. All that matters here is a sincere apology and a commitment to stop the behavior (which obv didn‚Äôt happen) 3) the preemptive defusing of your complaints to others instead of addressing you directly and privately is another no-no. It could be that she was just nervous and didn‚Äôt know how to proceed so she took a safe-seeming path (albeit a wrong one) in hopes that by telling others you were upset with her that you would understand that she acknowledges she did wrong and that you have reason to be upset. It also could be a narcissist gaslighting attempt. Unfortunately impossible to really know her heart on this one.   My advice (I am just a dude and not an HR pro) is, frankly, to use your gut. If you aren‚Äôt going to be working for her going forward, what is the degree of importance you place on getting a resolution for this specific incident?

Even if your employment agreement (It is not clear if you are a contractor or employee by your post) or your company in general has a system where you can get financial assistance for being off work due to a covid exposure, it is not illegal to just not pay you for no reason. It is illegal to not pay you for some reasons, but you have to prove it. That will be difficult. If you do prove it, it is highly unlikely that you would get anything more than what you should have gotten, which won't amount to much.  The thing is, your exposure was not a quarantine triggering exposure unless you were closer than 6 feet for more than 20 minutes, a detail you most definitely should have been asked about and reported accurately. If you now have symptoms, that is a seperate issue and while it might be related, there would be no way for even a doctor to know that.   You met a person with covid but did not have exposure the cdc requires a quarantine for and it sounds like you either incorrectly reported it or it was handled incorrectly.

You do not need to sign anything or agree to anything to be entitled to that money. It is based on years of service as per the ESA (details will be available online). It is not required if the termination is ""for cause"".   -Severance is payment above and beyond the ESA minimum. It is usually offered in exchange for signing a release agreement so that you cannot pursue any additional legal action against the company. It is calculated based on many factors including: length of service, age, level (manager, executive, individual contributor etc), education, salary, location and is supposed to reflect the amount necessary to sustain you until you find a suitable similar position. A simple calculation people often provide is 1 month per year of service but that isn't necessarily true.   - There needs to be consideration for a contract to be valid (you need to have some benefit) so definitely do not sign anything if they are not offering you more than the ESA minimum, but if you do it is likely not enforceable   - You must be provided time to consult with a lawyer before being required to sign anything  -Cause is very difficult to prove and the onus is on the employer to prove it. Do not be dismayed if they claim for cause, you will have additional recourse. Post again if that happens or speak with a lawyer of course.

They need to list the reason for termination with sufficient evidence . IE ; if performance based termination they need to show continue effort of performance improvement plan failures leading to termination .  If you have been belittled in front of other colleges or yelled at in open forum it can be classified as bullying.

909,t7dfil,hzi2pzr,"OP, just FYI, but given the nature of the topic and the fact that you posted on a weekend you are getting responses from a lot of lay people instead of HR professionals.  Most of the advice is still great (this is in no way your fault, dude should know better, etc.) but some of it is clearly from non-HR folks (run to an attorney before even speaking with HR).  Just take everything here a larger grain of salt than normal.  A lot of the responses are more concerned with making this jerk pay than giving you the advice you are seeking.  You say above he is your boss, but in a comment here you clarify that he is actually more of a trainer and manager of the lab while you technically report to someone else.  That's a big difference from a legal standpoint.  It still doesn't exonerate him from being a creepy dumbass and his behavior is still legally and ethically problematic (he has power over you even if he is not your boss), but the fact that he is not your boss coupled with him stopping immediately when you asked him to means this may not be sexual harassment in a legal sense.    If he had been your boss, reporting him to HR would *very likely* have resulted in his termination.  But with the added information, I feel while it could still result in termination (it would if I had a say) it could just result in disciplinary action instead.  Which would mean you have to continue to work with him even after reporting.  You may want to report it anyway, but just be aware of that.  Another fact to consider is that if you choose not to report now to make your work life easier, you can always change your mind and report later (especially if he does *not* stop as expected).  Save those texts.  Bottom line: you are not to blame for anything of this.  You have more power here than you think; you have a right to continue working in the lab you love without this dude hitting on you.  You can do that by taking him at his word and seeing how it goes, or by reporting him to HR (yours first since you have two to choose from) and getting the full force of HR behind you.  The second option could result in him losing his job, which isn't exactly a bad thing and if it happens then, again, it isn't your fault.  It's his.  You can, also, decide to leave.  That's the path of least drama, but also the result in which you are punishing yourself for something not your fault.

I'm so sorry this has happened to you and unfortunately, as a woman, this sort of thing is not unusual. I also want to point out that while it is good you have reflected on things and see that you participating in the flirting was a bad move, this situation is on him. He is the married man, he is in a position of power to you and is supposed to be your mentor. While it is easy for his ego to get a good stroking when a young female looks up to him,  he is the one who needs to be aware of the power dynamic and not be a creep and also have the self awareness to understand what is going on.   Think of it this way....if you had a co-op student reporting to you who you found attractive, would you hit on them even if they flirted with you, or would you try to avoid flirting and if needed have a frank conversation about workplace professionalism?   You have a few options in front of you and some of them are of a wait and see nature depending on your comfort level. You already did the right thing and told him clearly that you are not interested and do not want any physical advances or romantic things going on between you.  It would be wise for you to document this for your own notes with dates and times and what he said and what you said (this is to present to your own HR in case anything escalates). Your HR needs evidence of things as much as possible otherwise he can deny things or claim you misunderstood. Texting screenshot would be good to keep in your notes too. Keep this in your personal files, not on a workplace device.  If you feel comfortable going to work right now, you keep on as usual being careful to watch for any retaliation on his part or pushing those flirtatious boundaries. It might be best to keep conversations focused on work as much as possible and minimize texting on personal devices. You can outright communicate this boundary to him and explain it as wanting to keep thing professional and respect the mentorship relationship you have built, or you can just start minimizing those non-work interactions yourself and only explain why if he asks. I've been in some situations where the other person respects wishes and takes a more professional tone going forward but unfortunately I've heard of plenty of cases where they do keep pushing boundaries or create a toxic workplace.  If he does start escalating anything or retaliating, you continue to clearly state your boundaries and you report what is happening to your HR. Your safety is priority and at that point his behaviour is harassment. You have every right to report him and ask to be transferred if he is making you uncomfortable. Your HR has a duty to keep you safe and they can talk with his HR about what is happening and have them deal with him. It isn't in your company's interest to have their contractors being sexually harassed and quitting.  If HR is dismissive of things and doesn't do anything useful, then you should quit. You don't have to put up with sexual harassment at work, full stop. While harassment is common, it is not normal. I know you are new to industry, don't want to make waves and just want to brush things off, but I can promise you that do not need to put up with this shit.   In the meantime, it would be wise to start looking for another job and get your resume up to date just in case. As tedious as it is to job hunt, other opportunities are out there that don't involved being creeped on by your married mentor.  I've been in your shoes and it is stressful, upsetting and scary.

I don't understand how some people here cannot see that point of view.  I thought you explained the convention behind Chinese nicknames really well, and all the commenters saying that ""your nicknames for them are unprofessional"" have no idea what they are talking about.

Does claiming gender discrimination stop the employer from taking legitimate action to address the performance and demote or fire the employee?

They promoted or hired OP in the first place, so I have a bit of a hard time accepting 100% of this issue is blatant discrimination.",4,False,

But, from a practical side, can I summarize your complaints as follows?  * Lack of training and support for your new position  * Excluded from meetings  * Not assigned job tasks commensurate with your position  * Given tasks and reports that other supervisors are not given  * Your direct reports do not respect you (and refuse to do what you aks)  You attribute all these things to you being a women.  Why are you convinced that it is because you are a woman and not because you are inexperienced and lack leadership skills?  The last one, specifically, is clearly a lack of leadership skills.  If your employees are not capable, or not willing, to do the tasks that you assign to them, then you need to fix that.  That's your problem, not your boss's problem (unless you make it her problem).",1,False,

1316,qiaveh,himze98,"You describe a series of what appear to be work related slights (differential treatment based on gender) about which you complained to Mgr & HR. Demotion following complaints certainly raises a retaliatory specter.   The reason given for the demotion does seem contradictory to the recent promotion.  The key will be in proof of your allegations.   I agree with some commenters that job search is a viable alternative. With the current ""great resignation"" you should have little difficulty finding another suitable opportunity.  Conferring with an attorney is a reasonable alternative. A prerequisite for an EEO sex discrimination complaint is filing with EEOC or CA human rights agency.  (you or the atty can do this) File within 300 days of harm.   Some objective thoughts on what you describe: The differential treatment examples you have given appear to me to be ""slights.""   You describe no gender slurs or degrading harassment. You say ""no help at all."" Do other supervisors get help and you don't?  You're given ""no tasks or simple tasks;"" could this be a training element where job functions were given gradually so as not to overwhelm you?    One key in proving sex discrimination is to detail how you were treated compared to male comparators.  EEOC and the courts will look at frequency and severity of discriminatory or harassing conduct.  Make a list- dates, times, places, events, details.   From the outside, I'm wondering  about your handling of the insubordinate employee. Perhaps the boss expected you - as supervisor- to deal with the matter by disciplining or discharging the offender.   When you texted the boss about the offender, did you just identify the problem or did you also outline your planned corrective action to deal with the matter?    These are the kinds of issues that will be brought out if-when you decide to file an eeo claim.  Good luck.",1,False,

The attacker called the victim, pretending to be someone they're not, and the victim failed to properly identify the attacker.   The attacker managed to get their hands on the girlfriend's information, and used it to (probably) attempt secondary social engineering attacks, or maybe just basic scams of some sort.   ---  What you can do:  **Most of the time** these sorts of things are financial in nature.  The attacker isn't interested in harming anyone, just getting to bank accounts and such.  That, however, is not a reason to not be cautious.    The steps taken by the company so far are decent.  Moving people around and similar is a good move, as it makes the information gathered earlier less relevant.    The girlfriend should absolutely start screening their calls.

Be sure to do it from a company laptop / computer / phone, and provide as much detail as possible.  This group cares about data breaches, which is what happened here.

1380,qk17rf,hiu8i0i,"   Generally, companies will honor a two-week notice and pay the employee for the last two weeks even if the employer does not allow the employee to work during that time period. But, no federal law requires the employer to pay employees or even allow them to work during that two-week notice period.       However, there are several situations or conditions that should be considered. The employer and the employee may be contractually bound by a written policy implemented by the employer. If your policy states that employees are required to provide two weeks‚Äô notice prior to leaving the company and that they will be paid during that time, then the company should follow the policy and pay employees, even if it removes them from the schedule or tells them that they do not have to work the notice period.  On the other hand, if your policy states that the company is not required to pay employees during the entire notice period, then the company will be required to pay for only hours actually worked. The common practice is for a policy to state something to the effect that two weeks‚Äô notice is ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù or ‚Äúrequested‚Äù and be silent on the matter of pay. In those situations, the company is not legally obligated to pay for time not worked during the two-week period. However, any time actually spent working must be paid.      Another consideration is unemployment benefits. If you require two weeks‚Äô notice and then remove an employee from the schedule or tell her that she is not going to be allowed to work, you may be turning her resignation into a termination. Of course, there may be extenuating circumstances when that is appropriate, but be careful because such an action may result in the employee being entitled to unemployment benefits.      Also, there are situations involving exempt employees. While one of the legally recognized exceptions for deductions from salary or exempt workers‚Äô pay is for working a partial week during their final workweek, the exception is meant to apply when it is their decision to work only part of the final work week. If they intend and are willing to work the entire work week and the employer permits them to work only part of the week, then the employer is responsible for their salary for the whole workweek. By not paying an exempt employee for the entire workweek, the employer may run afoul of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

Eligibility for fringe benefits is generally up to the employer, so you don't necessarily have any automatic entitlement to them after any particular length of time or because you are working a certain number of hours per week. You'd have to look at your employer's current written policies and see exactly what they say about eligibility. If they have discretion to deem you ""part-time"" or 'full-time"" and your status was never officially changed under your previous role, you'll have a very difficult time pursuing any sort of legal action against your employer on that basis. Even if eligibility is based solely on hours worked according to their policy, any legal challenge would have to go through the courts, and it would definitely not be resolved before August.   Your best bet is to take those text messages to your current manager and ask them to intercede with HR on your behalf, or escalate the matter to HR management directly yourself. It might just be a case of some information not being correct in the system and the HR employees you've been dealing with not having the authority or the interest in fixing it.   Using your other job offer is risky; no matter how indispensable you might think you are, they might still call your bluff and refuse, or even just terminate you outright. Even if they agree to give you benefits now, they might consider you a flight risk in the future and might look to replace you with someone more loyal (or just less demanding) in short order.

There needs to be a gap of time available for HR to go through your records and confirm you are actually making enough hours and will continue to do so.

Your FMLA had to be approved for specific instances of you being gone, and if it is intermittent which based on your response it sounds like it is, then they should have said ""Approved for so and so absences in so and so amount of time"" So for example, I had an employee taking a family member to the doctor once a week and was approved for 4 hour absences once a week. At one point he started taking more than one day off or taking a full day off. At that point we asked for his doctor to re-certify as the absence frequency had changed.

I would be honest with them on what you have noticed and feel as if they have given up on you and are just trying to go through the process to get terminated.

During the time of being unemployed, I made sure to have a gratitude list next to my to-do list. Things like applying for unemployment, medicaid, and food stamps can take awhile, as well as getting a new job. Some days I would barely make a dent in my to-do list even though I worked really hard. The gratitude list helped keep my moral in check.

Women have a very real pressure to ‚Äúbe polite‚Äù heavily ingrained from a young age. I am personally VERY hesitant to do something that feels as though it‚Äôs breaking a social norm when a man is making me uncomfortable because doing something to outwardly convey fear or panic (beyond indicating discomfort and signs of distancing) can easily flip the switch from someone being creepy or relentless to dropping any guise of normalcy and go full on belligerent.

Having said that if she gets the opportunity to discuss the environment this DM creates in material terms to HR without sounding hysterical she should. She can also express, as a preference, to the DM how she wishes to be communicated with in a non defensive, professional manner. For example: comments about her experience and age can be responded to with: ‚ÄúI respect your experience, and apologize if I have caused offense. Can you please let me know the best way to communicate with you on the issue so we can resolve it? What‚Äôs your preferential form of communication?‚Äù  Sometimes people will tell you how they prefer to be treated and that might be a path to an easier relationship.   Good luck!",35,False,

You don‚Äôt need to talk back, just show that you‚Äôre not fazed, the comments reflect on the bully, not you.   Another thing that helps control the anxiety in the situation is to think about if the DM has firing powers. Likely, the DM is all bark and no bite.

Maybe talking to your team or one or two members who you are closest to and explaining to them what's going on might help.  You don't need to tell theme everything - you can say ""Hey, I just wanted to talk to you.  I know you've had to take on some extra work because of my absence and I really appreciate it.  I have a medical condition that I've been adjusting to and needed to WFH for a few days and then there was a death in the family.  It's been a lot all at once but I'm hopeful I'm through the worst.""  Now back to the meeting.  Go with an open mind and listen to what they have to say.  If they do end up firing you, ask them specifically why.  What is their reason for terminating your employment?  If they give some broad answer like ""It's not working out"" then just accept it and leave quietly.  Don't give them anything to hold against you and don't get them any advance notice that you're aware of your rights so they can circle the wagons. If they give you a specific reason then ask yourself  if they're right and justified in that.  If they've fired you for any reason that could possibly be related to your pregnancy, then you can look into filing a complaint with the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov) to start.  You might want to look around for free legal services and talk to a lawyer who might be able to assist you in filing a complaint.  You don't *need* a lawyer to file a complaint, but they're more experienced in working with the EEOC and they might have more information about any state specific laws.  Remember, be calm and go in with an open mind.  Expect the best, but prepare for the worst.  Good luck.",10,False,

Sorry, no specific advice but still going to post in case anyone searches for similar terms and is based in England or Wales.  Good luck with your issues!  ----  Any absence related to pregnancy puts you pretty much in the clear, you'd likely win at a tribunal if they tried to get rid of you for that. The law has strong protections for pregnancy.   Did your fit note say your absence was pregnancy related? If not, go back to your GP and ask them to rewrite it for you retroactively. I'm assuming your manager is aware you're pregnant.  They can kick up a fuss about the bereavement leave, but if you took it in line with policy then you should be safe (two days off for a close bereavement is pretty reasonable). They could try to fire you for that absence (and can pretty much fire you for anything in the first two years) but it'd be so blatantly related to your pregnancy that again, you'd likely win in court.  This assumes you haven't had a lot of absence or any performance issues prior to your pregnancy related absence as that could change things to an extent.  I'd be telling your HR (ask for a separate meeting first thing on Monday) that you manager has allowed and possibly encouraged your team to treat you differently (""gain their respect back"") due to your pregnancy related absence and that you're considering putting in a grievance as you're being treated differently as a direct result of your pregnancy. Any HR person worth anything will be all over that!  Do bear in mind that this could cause friction with your manager/team, just so you're thinking about the full picture.  You can also speak to [pregnant then screwed](https://pregnantthenscrewed.com/) as they're a great resource for pregnancy related issues. [ACAS](http://acas.org.uk) are also helpful.  As usual NAL, but work in HR and regularly get annoyed at managers who have no idea how to treat their staff properly! Please seek formal/professional guidance before taking any action.",4,False,

1666,rydd7f,hrpz2lj,"When I was 19(F) I went into work early one wednesday so I could leave early because I had a doctors appointment later that day. My boss (42M) arrived shortly after me which was unusual and we were the only 2 in office for about an hour. He came up behind me while I was at my desk. I could feel him behind me and when I went to turn to ask what he was doing, he grabbed me hard by my braid and yanked my head back against him and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know braids like this are every man‚Äôs fantasy?‚Äù with a creepy fucking look on his face. I yelled for him to let go and ran to the bathroom where I locked myself in until the rest of the staff came in. I told EVERYONE I worked next too and reported it to his manager who told me he would handle it and apologized. Later that day my boss stopped me before lunch with a fellow male coworker. He insisted I tell this other coworker it was just a joke and I wasn‚Äôt going to tell anyone else. They both laughed and said it was harmless. I stood my ground and said it was sexual harassment. The next day, my boss‚Äôs manager held a meeting with the two of us and I was fired.   2 months later the company called to offer me my job back and apologize. Turns out he was being inappropriate with several women and he failed a UA, testing positive for meth. They must have thought I might file a suit against them or something but I didn‚Äôt accept the offer and I laughed that they even tried in the first place.   I‚Äôm 29 now and have so much more confidence and little tolerance for anything unwarranted. I‚Äôve educated myself more on workplace employee rights. I would definitely report this.

1671,rydd7f,hrpkobz,"Report it!! Doesn't sound good at all. I'm sorry this happened to you! In general this is a mess and someone who is older should know better.  It also wayyy worse given the language used.  I would report it, say you were ""uncomfortable"" and what they said was ""inappropriate and put you in an awkward, no-win situation.""  *In overt or repeated situations, like this, you MUST use the words ""sexual harassment"" with HR.*  Since you're also doubting yourself, I'd also ask HR what the line is for workplace fraternization and harassment, for future reference... It will help you be more sure in your response because this will happen again at some point.  For example, imo asking if someone would be ""up for grabbing drinks after work sometime"" would be fine in my book... but commenting at all on someone's appearance, other than ""is that a new wristwatch?"" is a no go in a work setting. Especially for men. Sadly, it is a double standard, but it has to be as women are more vulnerable at work.  If you reflect on if it were a female who said it slightly differently, I think you might feel differently. And that's okay. You should know that, also the guy who said it does know that. And he said it anyway.  So consider that while we want to be proggressive about roles and power dynamics in our work and romantic lives, the reality is men harass women all the time because they get away with it, AND they also get mixed messages that make them THINK they got away with it.... Add in the fact that traditional roles want men to initiate all actions, you have a recipe for men and women not working safely together. So the best practice is to create an asexual workplace, be very clear and firm on your own boundaries, and then as men, get out enough that you don't feel you have to hit on people at work.  I think it's important to understand the potential for these things to go south. I'm a straight white male. I had a wonderful female bisexual boss who commented on me being a ""hottie"" as a guy, and my outfit, immediately after I was hit on by a gay client. I've also had a much older coworker bend over and show me their cleavage to embarrass me asking if I'd want to take a photo. The key difference is that nothing was implied as intention in those comments, even the cleavage incident, so I didn't report them. But, both were kind of awkward tbh.  I had a different female boss who asked probing questions and teased me about my sex life, while alone at work on the clock, and I did not answer them and told her I didn't feel comfortable. She quickly wrote me up for something unrelated--at which point yes, I 100% said to HR that btw you should know that person harassed me on the clock about my sex life. Because sadly, people manipulate work relationships and fake friendship dynamics to gain leverage over you. And it would have been better for me to say something before being written up, but frankly with the evidence I had (lots of gossip at that workplace) they believed me.  That boss later cried to me asking why I reported it, and that she thought we were friends. I explained I did it to protect myself and that as a boss she should know better than to try and engage subordinates in conversations about sex. (Which btw, it can come from ANY level but it is clearer if they are a boss).  ...I say all this so you know you're not alone, it is real, it happens to EVERYONE and so you and others can understand the difference in INTENT behind a joke or comment.... His intentions were clearly bad.  I think the real risk here is that if you do nothing, then it will 100% continue for you AND others after you. And you're not doing that older coworker any favors either.  I don't know the guy, but if he's truly old and experienced dating, it sounds like he's a creep and should know better.",2,False,

How is paperwork and documents handled?

1717,nzv31a,h1sz8fn,"Hi OP. Congrats on your new job. Enjoy your sabbatical before you start new job (if you can). Nothing to be anxious about. Relax & trust the process.   I interviewed, accepted new job & signed offer letter end of February last year. Right before Covid quarantine began. My start date was April 1st permanently from home. I heard nothing from the Firm for over 3 weeks. I didn‚Äôt worry.   On March 29th, I received a UPS shipment with my laptop, monitors, office phone and all of the equipment I would need for my new role. IT included an instruction chart to set everything up with a checklist of all systems & apps I had access to with ID‚Äôs & temporary passwords.   HR included employee benefit manual in UPS package for me to review along with links to choose my benefits including 401k on day one of employment.  I had everything set up & ready to go the night before day one. I received a text message on day one from IT inviting me to connect to the VPN via Radius.  I was logged in, all temporary passwords changed, benefits selected, etc. in under 30 minutes total on day one. IT was pleasantly surprised when they called me on my new office phone & learned I had completed all IT steps with no issues. This was confirmed by IT.   My assigned IT colleague sent email to HR informing them I was ready for HR on-boarding. I received HR link by email. Followed the instructions and was completely on-boarded in less than 15 minutes. Our HR Director called me, welcomed me to the Firm and verified I had completed all HR on-boarding steps. I emailed copy of my social security card and my drivers license to HR Director.   I received a text from the Firm on day one congratulating me on a successful on-boarding with a link to doordash with a $200 gift card balance for me & my family. Incredible gesture. (At my 90 day review, I was shipped a monogrammed laptop bag with Firm logo with a note telling me thank you for all my hard work and how valued I was by the Firm. Another incredible gesture.)  HR emailed my Directors I had completed all on-boarding steps. I had ZOOM meetings & Team meetings with my camera on with various colleagues & teams remainder of day one.   Best on-boarding in my career. Short & sweet. Beginning on day two, I was doing the duties of my role.  Later I learned, due to Covid, the Firm was pivoting & flying by the seat of their pants trying to hire, get new Associates on-board, while accommodating existing Associates to work from home per Covid quarantine protocol mandated by State governors & federal government.  Kudos to HR. They did a phenomenal job pre-Covid and now post-Covid.   You have nothing to worry about OP.  HR & your leadership team at your new job will reach out when necessary. No news is good news. Given we are returning to normal post Covid, HR & your leadership team may be pivoting between hiring Associates, on-boarding new Associates & working with current leadership & Associates regarding schedules of whose working from home versus whose returning to office on what days,  as is happening at my Firm currently.   HR & company leadership have much on their plates these days but they do have a process & system. Trust it. Just because you don‚Äôt hear from anyone at your new job doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre forgotten or not thought of. My Directors told me they were counting down the minutes until I came on-board so they could delegate much work. They have. I do the work of 5-6 Associates.

One specialty team has no joke about 50Ÿ™ people who claimed asylum from their old country. Another production team has about 50% Spanish speakers even though it's not a benefit for the job at all. The senior HR team is entirely women. Our patient care positions lean heavily toward women. The more I see of the company the more I see these trends.   I honestly don't think it's done in malice; the people they choose are usually arguably the most qualified, sometimes they are referrals from those in the department, sometimes they have very similar work styles/goals to the team, etc. Sometimes that field is just very saturated with a certain demographic (some cities lean toward certain secondary languages, some job titles lean toward one gender in terms of applicants.) That said, I think in the long term it builds up and the teams look very homogenous.",8,False,

1740,nyob76,h1lbi25,"(Not HR) but I am in management and had a similar issue as you. I was promoted in to my position over a more senior staff member. She has been with the company longer than me and she is in a position of extremely confidential information. Info I was not privy to prior to my promotion. She is the only person who knows how to do her job, where the information is, how to access it etc.   It was very difficult to get her to hand over the ‚Äòkeys‚Äô to her information. In fact, she told me a few times, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm supposed to share this with anyone. Lol internally I laughed because obviously yes, I‚Äôm ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to know these details and most I had already been brought up to speed on by the CFO and HR director when I was promoted. But I appreciated her confidentiality. It still made me chuckle that as her manager, she would tell me she wasn‚Äôt sure I was privy to the details of her job.   Someone is going to have to replace Jim so you‚Äôre going to have to find someone on the team or consider what you will do about replacing him. (How and when you‚Äôll begin looking for his replacement).  You need to know where all the information is stored and how he accesses it (if you don‚Äôt already know). You‚Äôre going to have to spend time with Jim to get to know what he does because now it IS your job to know what Jim does and now you‚Äôll need someone else to know also. I think the meeting with the VP will likely lead you to a better plan of action and how to handle this but my approach was to hire an assistant for this person in my department. (Let‚Äôs call her Jan).   Over a 6 month period, Jan trained this new ‚Äòassistant‚Äô. The new ‚Äòassistant‚Äô had all the same access that Jan had and in essence, Jan was training her replacement. Jan is also retirement age. It is not out of line for the company to be proactive in replacing someone who is retirement age. It is almost irresponsible for a company to have only one person who has all the knowledge of their job, especially proprietary or confidential information. Shoot, Jim could get hit by a bus tomorrow and then the company would severely struggle with no back up plan.   Jim‚Äôs attitude is concerning but also makes sense. The company has laid a heavy burden on him. He has zero back up (how does he take vacation?). He‚Äôs working nights and weekends to get his job done with zero access to team help.  You could approach Jim with the plan that you‚Äôre concerned that Jim has too much on his plate and that you want to hire an assistant or a teammate for him. Jim is likely to balk at this especially because people like Jim and Jan take great pride in being the ones holding the key to proprietary and confidential information. Jan‚Äôs emotional break down came because she felt like without that golden key she had held for 20 years, she would lose herself or that she would be seen as a failure. I spent a lot of time emotionally supporting Jan through this transition, patting her on the back and making her feel special. It was quite exhausting and ate up a lot of my time that I didn‚Äôt actually have. But I needed the key that she held. In order to gain access and knowledge from Jan (she‚Äôs an incredibly valuable employee), I had to have a lot of patience and compassion for what this all meant to her.   Spoiler alert - I ended up not letting Jan go. The more that got transitioned off of her desk to the ‚Äòassistants‚Äô desk, the better Jan got with letting go and she started to calm down day by day.  She originally was extremely territorial. It was NOT an easy transition but now, things are really good. Jan is happier. She is less stressed. She‚Äôs one year out from agreed upon retirement date and she‚Äôs enjoying this last year at the company, guiding her replacement, sharing the load, being nice to those around her. She hasn‚Äôt lost her temper in almost a year now.   I don‚Äôt think you can just fire Jim because you need him right now. But you can begin to make a plan for his exit. I think the VP and Hr director (who might know Jim really well) are likely to have a better idea of how you can manage transitioning Jim in to retirement. The fact that Jim is not even considering or planning his own retirement tells me that Jim doesn‚Äôt want to retire or maybe he financially can‚Äôt. As a long term employee, if you can help Jim to transition without just firing him, it will be better for everyone, the company and for Jim.   Someone else said that you‚Äôre a saint. And yes. Yes you are a saint. Good job on keeping your cool and managing this as best you can.",95,False,

1742,nyob76,h1lzksb,"First, there are baseline appropriate expectations. You can want to discover \*why\* he is not meeting them but ultimately, it doesn't matter. You put an end to them.  1. If you have a meeting with a VP (or any deadline) and he can't make it he has to let you know in due course without you chasing him up. He's not a kid. This isn't an entry level role., you shouldn't have to teach that. That performance with the VP is inexcusable.  2. His temper and swearing is also inexcusable. He needs to chekc that behaviour. if he is allowed to do this well, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept.  Assuming the quality of his work is good you have two issues:  1. He is a single point of failure. 2. He has zero time management skills.  So, what I would do is a few things:  1. Talk to him about the services you have to emotionally support employees. He is stressed and it may not even be about work. But it can't come out at work like this. 2. Give him the project work. Structure the deadlines for him. His poor time management means he doesn't get to manage his time anymore. Continuously missing a meeting with a VP? He has noped his way into this situation and being responsible is his way out. If he continues to miss deadlines he might be staring at a PIP. 3. Meanwhile, any ""fires"" have to come to your first. You decide their urgency, and you decide which - if any - he has to immediately attend to. You also find out who is sending him all this stuff. Is it historical? Is it people not doing their work on the other end? What? Start figuring out the answers with other team members. If Jim were not there what would you do.  Finally:  1. You have gone above and beyond for this guy. He hasn't responded, so now you are going to move ahead. And he can be on the train or under it. 2. Prep HR and the VPs for Jim's departure. There is an overall narrative here: Jim has been the master of his own domain under previous management. What is done is done. On your watch there will be appropriate behaviour, deadlines met, and no single point of failure,. Ensure you have their support. 3. Go out to the people who are inappropriately relying on Jim.

He had managed to complete projects when needed but procrastinated badly.  It sounds like Jim does the same, right?  Well, last year covid and several other things triggered a very serious depressive episode along with his ADHD.  He did  EVERYTHING Jim does.  He didn‚Äôt blow up as much but he certainly just stopped meeting any deadlines. Until that point he had started out fabulously, winning awards etc but slowly declined to mild procrastination but completion until last year he didn‚Äôt even finish anything. They let him go after 20 years and he wound up hospitalized for a few weeks.  He would not have gotten treatment if he had not been fired.  He would not have been able to admit something was even wrong with him if he hadn‚Äôt been fired.  He was warned 3 times in writing so he had nobody to blame but himself.   It sucks but you have to start the process.  He MAY be depressed now, as many of us are because of the crazy year we all had.

Not because he wants be so I‚Äôm going to be generous and ascribe his lashing to come from a place of fear and not one of maliciousness our arrogance.   I agree with you and others on the fact that you need to find someone to offload some of his work to and unfortunately he is going to have to be the one to train that person. Since I feel that his anger is coming from fear, I think that you have to be very clear with him that he is training someone so you can decrease his workload, not replace him. Also, since Jim may seem to be a bit cynical at this stage of his career and may not be completely trusting even if you try to tell him that, you may even go so far as to tell him that his anger is an issue and you believe it is caused by his stress due to the workload and if that the only reason he should fear losing his position is because of the anger issue and rather than trying to train someone to replace him, you are in fact trying to train someone to save him. I think that puts him in a position where he will likely be more receptive and open to training. I don‚Äôt want to be too cliche-y but that approach kind of answers the question that will be in Jim‚Äôs head - ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù  Edit:  Also, after reading some of the other suggestions, I‚Äôd work to find out who or where Jim gets the knowledge that he needs to put out a fire or do something for a project and, assuming that those requests come via email, I would go to the people sending these requests for firefighting and project work and request that they cc you on any request for Jim. That might give you some insight into Jim‚Äôs struggles. And, depending on your workload, you may even go so far as becoming a gatekeeper and instead of the requests being sent to Jim, have them sent to you instead of Jim and then you can decide whether someone else on your team can handle the request. I‚Äôd tell Jim that I was requesting people do that and maybe even when you get a request tell Jim that you got it, what is was, who you were going to assign it to, and ask Jim if that person can come to Jim if they need some direction.",1,False,

A ""supported transition out of the company"" will typically not infringe on your ability to take PTO, which you will need for interviews.  They are telling you that they want you out of the company, but want you to continue doing your job for the company as usual while the agreed upon separation date approaches.  You MIGHT also be eligible for a separation agreement package (essentially a small-to-moderate bonus payout).    A PIP on the other hand puts you entirely at the mercy of your boss.  PIPs essentially allow management to bend the rules and the terms of your schedule and job duties in an effort to ""bring your performance back to satisfactory levels.""  Your boss even said the PIP ""won't be easy"" meaning that **his intention is to find a reason to terminate you at the first opportunity.**  PIPs are seldom about salvaging the employee - I've never seen a PIP actually produce the end result of ""Improved Performance"" since the employee is typically under so much pressure and stress that they burn out entirely.  You will also **not** be able to interview because on a PIP, you can forget about taking time off.

1930,nh3l9m,gywso9w,"I used to be an in house lawyer advising a large company on issues like this.   I have a few questions.  Did your doctor sign an ADA certification form saying that you can't leave the house at all or can't ever go into an office or can't travel more than 30/60/90 minutes across town for business? What specifically is your limitation and why?   It takes an hour to go to the grocery store, to doctor's appointments, to church etc. can you not do any of that either?  Sometimes businesses are skeptical when an employee claims ""I can't do the unpopular part of my job. Medical reason, you know.""  And because some doctors will sign notes saying whatever the patient wants,  the employee will then hand over a note from a doctor saying ""My patient Bob has a medical condition that conveniently precludes him from doing the parts of his job that he and his co-workers really hate doing.""  Obviously your condition qualifies as a disability and your iliostomy and bathroom challenges are very real. But someone who is not a doctor, and who doesn't have an iliostomy, may be wondering ""What? He can't leave the house? Ever? Why can't he use the bathroom at home and empty the bag and then drive across town and use the bathroom when he arrives? Or stop halfway at a gas station and use a bathroom? Why is he saying he'll be without an available bathroom for hours? And doesn't the bag hold the poop until he can get to a bathroom?"" (Note: I'm aware that gas stations in urban areas often don't have public bathrooms and that COVID has made bathroom access in gas stations and restaurants very hit or miss).  >Another employee that has the exact same job as me was allowed to work from home and not make trips across town while pregnant. That's understandable. What I don't understand is how she, more than a year after childbirth, is still allowed to work from home and is not required to take trips across town, while I am refused the same accommodation. From what I understand, she is allowed to work from home to watch her children.  This is a fair argument. The employer may say her job isn't the same as yours. I don't know. The employer also may suspect that you, like many employees COULD leave the house to work but you, like many employees, just prefer working for home and you know that your co-worker Becky is allowed to work from home, so now you're just being a pain in the ass demanding the Becky deal and claiming your medical condition requires it when it really doesn't.  But the employer doesn't want to say ""We think you're milking this medical condition and could drive across town if you really wanted to"" so instead they're saying ""Oh, we can't accommodate it, business needs and all.""  And that may end up being a mistake on their part, because the Becky precedent undermines their argument.  You might have a strong ADA claim if they demote or fire you, in part because Becky was allowed to work from home.   Anyway, part of what I'm trying to convey is that just because your doctor says your medical condition prevents you from traveling across town doesn't mean your employer believes that.

While the fact that they want you to perform the same work you were previously doing as a normal employee is a potential argument against your being an independent contractor, other factors may outweigh that. It's certainly possible for a company to outsource the function of an employee or a set of employees to a genuine independent contractor, and while it's unusual to do so by hiring the same employee you just fired to do said work, as long as your relationship with your former employer actually changes such that you are truly independent from their control going forward, you might legitimately be able to be classified as an independent contractor.   Whether you want to accept this offer is another matter, of course. If you want to consider it, when negotiating your fee, don't forget to take into account the fact that you will be responsible for more taxes as a contractor, and won't have the same benefits such as health insurance or paid time off that you did as a full-time employee, so your asking rate should be a fair bit higher than your previous effective hourly rate.

You may be forced to be part of a healthcare plan if you're in a union, or if you signed an employment agreement that said you'd be part of the company's group health plan.  This fee may be penalty for failing to meet the terms of that contract, if it exists.  Otherwise.. there's just no way this is legitimately legal.  Your employer is forcing you to either purchase something you don't need or want (healthcare) or pay a penalty for failing to do that (the fee).  That's not a contract, that's extortion.

Is it legal? I mean, probably. There are not laws expressly prohibiting retaliation for everything. Like, they could probably give you a pay cut for wearing green socks on sundays, but they can't give you one for being a member of the green sock church or identifying as a green sock.   You could potentially prove that you were given a pay cut because you are married, a protected class, through disparate impact.  The bigger question is why the fuck did they do this, and what does it mean? Why they did it will probably tell you if this is where you really want to work, and if you leave, you could probably pursue a disparate impact claim.

2080,sa3xyy,htrrhti,"Okay I think you really need to back up here and take the emotion out of what you're saying here.  I know it sucks when someone at work doesn't like you and getting along with them is difficult but your emotional narrative of what you believe happened is probably straining the reality of what's going on and it's not actually helping you.   It's succeeding in upsetting you and stressing you out, but you're not doing yourself any favors here.  You don't actually know any of the reasons why this person was promoted nor do you know that they were actually disciplined.  If the company policy prevents people from being promoted while performance or behavior improvement plans, then this suggests that whatever actions were taken to address the phone issue didn't have official steps taken to prevent her promotion.   As someone else has suggested, it's very possible the decision was made to move her away from you so there were no further conflicts.    Whatever the case, it's not actually your business how your employer choses to handle employee discipline unless the person being disciplined is you.  Being overly focused and emotionally invested in this hard to stop fixating on but for your health and sanity, you need to really try.   The results are just upsetting you and this situation can turn around on you and you can end up being disciplined for continuing to fixate.   If there's something to let go, this is it.  And the way you describe all of this, you seem very invested in continuing this conflict.  And I get why, you feel like you were treated fairly by your company and your sense of unfairness about this is continuing to drive your outrage.  Plus, it does suck when someone at work doesn't like you but there will always be people at work who don't like you, but most people are good at being polite and civil whatever their real feelings.   This door swings both ways, though.  In your narrative, you believe you're the victim and that may or may not be true, but even so, you also have be polite and civil to people at work whatever your real feelings.  Overall, I think there are three things here that you need to focus on:  Pick your battles.  This started because you overheard an out-of-work conversation that you believe was about you.  Maybe it was and maybe it wasn't but you have to examine the upside of escalating on things that aren't going to have any good end.  All of this seems to have blown up over an eavesdropped conversation.  Some things are not worth the effort of engaging on or bringing in the manager.  This is true in life but also especially true at work.    It may not see any resolution and it will just escalate on pointless conflict that is a distraction in the workplace, which honestly, is probably how your manager is viewing this whole situation.  Handle conflict directly.  If you believe there's an issue with someone that can't just be ignored and it's preventing work from being completed, you have to communicate with them in a professional manner directly first before bringing in a manager and try to work it out.   Then, you bring in the manager.   But if it's not preventing work from being done, it's often better to ignore the whole thing.  Find a new job.  Maybe this place is really messed up for a lot of reasons, but there's nothing to be done for it at this point.  The damage is done and, unfortunately, you've burnt some bridges in this situation that will probably make it harder for you going forward.

If he hasn't done so yet, he needs to fill out a Worker's Compensation claim form: [https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/DWCForm1.pdf](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/DWCForm1.pdf). His employer was supposed to give him one within 1 working day of reporting the injury. He fills out the employee portion and returns it to his employer, and then they are required to give him a completed copy of the form within 1 working day. The insurance company has 90 days to accept or deny the claim, but while the claim is being adjudicated he can get up to $10,000 in medical care from an approved doctor. After he has the first visit with the work's doctor, he can choose to see any doctor within their network.  Here are the phone numbers for all of the Information and Assistance Units in CA: [https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/IandA.html#IandAoffices](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/IandA.html#IandAoffices) He can call his local office on Monday and they can help him, but it sounds like he's going to need a worker's comp attorney to force his employer to do what they're legally required to do.",114,False,

Also, if you're in the US, and aren't given a form for ""first report of injury"" to fill out within 1 day, your company is skirting the law. Play dumb and get it in writing.

OP,  your brother needs to get medical care immediately for his health's sake and for the reason above. He should tell the employer in writing that he cannot go to work as requested because he must seek medical attention despite their instructions to delay it. If he uses a company email or phone, make sure he bcc's a private email and forwards all replies to it, too. Take screenshots of texts to send to another phone/email immediately. If they call him, have him only speak on speaker phone with a witness there. Don't let them take the proof away. If he is sure to tell the doctors it is a work-related injury, WC should pay for it regardless of the provider. Also, he needs to make sure the Dr. knows that he was denied medical care for days and ask them  to note any signs that the injury has gone days without care, and/or is days old, and has been made worse by lack of care.   If he required days away from work and/or care beyond first aid, this is a ""recordable injury,"" and must be reported to CalOSHA. Your brother should have been immediately taken for medical care, & the paperwork for Worker's Comp should have been completed by him and his supervisor within 1 day, and then by their folks within a day and returned to him. Them not doing this is criminal. He needs a lawyer ASAP. If your brother has contact information for anyone who witnessed the accident, make sure the lawyer has that too. If it was faulty equipment, or bad training,  etc that caused the injury, document it, and think about who can testify to it. But he shouldn't talk lawsuits until the lawyer says so, because he doesn't want yo tip his hand.  (Edited for typos)",2,False,

OK, first up, I want to echo the advice of others to the extent that this behaviour, as described, firmly falls into stalking, which is a criminal offence so you can and should go to the police.  However, as an HR professional I wanted to pick up on this point from your post.  1) There is no such thing as an ""informal"" versus a ""formal"" complaint. An employee grievance is a grievance and must be handled in accordance with the ACAS code regardless. A grievance may be submitted formally (in writing) or informally or resolved as such, but the obligation to address the grievance is the same.  2) The person who decides whether to submit a grievance formally or informally is the employee. The employer can't tell an employee that they *can't* submit a grievance formally (although they can seek to resolve one informally if the aggrieved consents to informal resolution).  3) There is no requirement for a witness to a grievance. In fact, requiring such behaviour to be witnessed is actively in defiance of good practice, common sense and legal precedent. An employer doesn't need to make a case against an employee to the same standards as a court of law, requiring only to believe that an offence occurred on the balance of probabilities (i.e. that it is more likely than not that the allegation is true).  I would like to believe that OP misunderstood the guidance given by HR. Sadly, I think it is more likely that OP was told what a manager thought would make the problem go away with the least effort on their part.

I'm telling you as someone who ended up being let go after giving my entire self to a company with a very similar sounding CEO and bosses - quit. Quitting was something I had thought about but was playing it safe and not willing to quit without a job offer. the thing is, i had no time to do applications or interviews because of my work load. I was tired, I was angry, I would cry constantly. Seeing picture of myself during that time, I look like a dead person walking, and I had only worked there 7 fucking months. I finally was open about how I was feeling in an upfront, direct way: I couldn't take more on, I needed support. I told them that on a Thursday. I was let go the Monday after I said it. It ruined me for at least a year - I found another job quickly enough  but left that one at 2 months in because I just couldnt handle anything. Getting fired was them taking the last bit of me - the sense of ANY control I had was gone because I told myself I would quit and that was the power I had. It was awful.     I'd prepare to resign at that meeting with the COO. I'm telling you it wont get better (and I think you know that). Any attempts to even hint that it could WILL take 6+ months to see any type of movement if any and if you bring it up again, you'll be told to ""be more flexible"" and be a ""team player"". Don't buy it. The company that fired me kept going downhill after I was let go. My entire team was either fired or left shortly after. The company still exists, the CEO is the same and now years later, It's the most traumatizing experience I've ever had.     Go into the meeting with the COO. Quit your job. Be polite. Give 2 weeks notice, DO NOT GIVE MORE because they will take it. DO NOT work at 200% during those 2 weeks - they're going to hate you no matter what you do. Accept you won't get a reference from the CEO but you can ask other people from your team even if they aren't a supervisor (this is accepted by the majority of places, I've tried it!).

Don't let this job, that you know you did a great job for and are now being treated like this, spill over in any way to your new position.

They're definitely banking on paying a premium to try to win concessions from the union or break them altogether, but it's never super clear just how high the cost will get.  But they get high, and quickly.  It's often less about the cost of training than it is the cost of wages going up on temp workers and the productivity going down because the new workers just don't care the same way because they're temps.    For instance, if you assume everything is exactly the same (no loss, no shrink, no extraneous costs), but they have to eat 10% in extra costs to train (most industry estimates say the cost of lost productivity in training one new worker is about 20% of their annual pay) and pay temps an extra $1/hour, that's about $3m in training costs and an extra $11k/day in additional wages.  And those would be wildly optimistic numbers to give.  As an anecdotal point of reference, there was a major grocery store strike in 2003-2004 in Southern California that covered about 70,000 employees, and the reported estimated losses from each of the three major chains were about an additional $2million/day (so about $6million/day in total).  Grocery is similiarly low skill, easy to replace labor, so it's a reasonable benchmark on costs.    That works out to about $85 per striking employee, per day in additional losses.  Plug that into an inflation calculator and it jumps to about $125/day, or just shy of $175,000/day in total additional expenditure.

If the person who is the best fit is from a underrepresented group, great! If they‚Äôre a white guy, also great! People often mistake this tactic for hiring based on identity rather than competency. It just happens that many candidate pools for certain roles in certain fields tend to be VERY, disproportionately white. There‚Äôs a ton of reasons for this. Most people outside of talent don‚Äôt realize that it often takes extra work and effort to build a candidate pipeline that is representative and diverse. Hence the extra efforts to find those candidates.",21,False,
2407,tt8w7q,i2wwvmr,"There are a lot of very good business reasons to actively seek out diversity. You generally want employees to in part reflect your desired customer base, you want variety in backgrounds, experience, and opinion to make informed decisions, and you want an inclusive culture, where perceived difference isn't a barrier to collaboration and teamwork. While it might be problematic to refuse to hire white people at all, I think if you post a listing and get exclusively white, male applicants, or any homogenous group really, it's definitely worth reflecting on whether the wording or descriptions of roles reached such a narrow audience.  I see how someone throwing around the phrase ""white male"" as a placeholder for ""lack of diversity"" might be off-putting, but in practice, they really do mean the same thing, especially in critical industries, pay rates, and positions of authority. There are lots of fields dominated by white males that lack diversity specifically because of a tradition in the U.S., and much of the rest of the business world, of white men actively excluding other groups from positions of influence and power. The job of someone in recruiting with a focus on diversity and inclusion is to quite literally figure out how to get candidates to apply who aren't white men. This can be really tricky for some companies, as relying on personal networks or traditional hiring sources can perpetuate an in-group bias. So there is a lot of focus on reaching a more diverse candidate pool, with success measured by, yes, the degree to which a non-homogeneous, and in our societal context, white male, pool of applicants expresses interest.  Personally, a lack of diversity is a red flag for me, as in my experience, it reflects a lack of strategic understanding of how to put together an effective work team, and in many cases can lead to some pretty gross abuses of power. For the record, I am a white man, and if I started a job at a company with exclusively white men, I'd be a little sketched out.

2431,njq3jd,gzanlep,"Counter thought here. I once worked with a manager (who at the time had no direct reports, he managed a process), he would tell people they were hired in to XYZ positions and tell them to call HR. Problem, this company did not hire for XYZ positions, at all. I was recruiting for a small conglomerate, and this particular business unit had ZERO need for what the manager said we would hire them for. The few times that skill was needed, we'd send someone over from a sister company for a couple weeks, here or there. There certainly wasn't a full time need for this skill.  There was one guy (we'll call him Jake) in particular who would call the manager once a week, the manager would tell Jake and to call HR for onboarding. Jake was relentless in calling me to schedule onboarding after each call with the manager. Each time I'd tell Jake ""we don't have that position."" Jake would then call the manager, call me back, argue with me, and round and round we'd go. This went on for months. I had to escalate back to my manager and then to the manager's higher up (several times), the manager would get spoken to, and it would start all over again. It took over 3 months of back and forth with Jake, my team and the manager's higher-ups to shut down the Jake calls. Finally, the manager got transferred to a partner company across town, and I didn't need to work with him anymore.   So yes, call HR directly. Find out what's up.

What's happening is that *your director's refusal to adequately staff your department* is causing a lot of issues.    People *will* get sick.  They *will* take vacations.  This is known.  So failing to plan for that eventuality, or take steps to remedy it when it happens, is a failure of management.

You should also not listen to them if they try to blame the other employee for causing the problem. FMLA is the law of the land, and employers who are covered are responsible for following the law.   The problem is that the amount of required work exceeds the available labor resources. So some work won't get done. Management needs to decide which work doesn't get done.

3163,uab0k5,i634sdy,"Sorry to hear this, OP. Something similar happened to me. I was laid off as a recruiter during the pandemic. Last year I was hired as a HR Generalist by a local non-profit agency. The department was super lean and two of us newbies were hired around the same time, so no mentor was available to help me (previous long term HRGs had both resigned within 30 days).  During call check-ins with my new manager, I asked questions that came up that I wasn't sure about. This had always been acceptable in the past at new jobs. After working 2.5 weeks, I was told it was my last day. I was told all my business partners liked me and it was through no fault of my own, but they were letting me go. Apparently, they claimed they didn't have the time to train/coach me and realized they assumed too much without asking better interview questions. I was completely honest on my resume and during the interview process which they acknowledged when I mentioned this fact. I was shocked and disappointed! BTW, no paper or signed document was handed to me on my last day.  Since I was curious what rock star would replace me, I watched their hiring process for the next month. Turns out, they couldn't find anyone better who would work for their lower-end salary, and they decided to promote a trainer into an HR Associate role! Since he had zero HR experience, he needed training/coaching! LOL. Oh, the irony! Also, his salary was less than mine, so I figure he got a raise and they wound up saving about $5-6k in the process. But the recruiting-hiring-termination-recruiting process cost is very high. Something like up to 20% of an employee's salary! Penny wise, but pound foolish. My organization does not generally fight unemployment claims, so I knew that wouldn't be a problem for me.  So, my point is that sometimes companies do very asinine and foolish things without weighing the consequences. They sometimes leap without looking. This department had nice people running it, but they are not the best leaders I have worked for. Sometimes you can do everything right, like I tried to do (e.g. attendance, performance, completing CBT trainings, meetings, etc), and still be let go. It was a total shock for me since nothing like this ever happened before, but I will never again think something like this is impossible. I wish you the very best in your UC process.

If that plant or animal is a person, not a flower or goat, they get described as ‚Äúwoman‚Äù or if under 18, then ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù   Calling women ‚Äòfemales‚Äô is a mistake that is regularly made by incels on the internet.   Apologies if English isn‚Äôt a first language, but there‚Äôs a difference in meaning and us women don‚Äôt take lightly to being called ‚Äúfemale‚Äù as a noun.   Also, it could be described as ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù or ‚Äúdomestic abuse of a partner‚Äù or ‚Äúassaulting another employee‚Äù, or ‚Äúanimal abuse‚Äù, regarding the type of ‚Äòassault on a female‚Äô that is happening here.   The cringe factor was off the charts even just typing that phrase once again.  Now, to your question.   Apparently some other HR folks answering don‚Äôt remember that NC is an at-will employment state, and that fact means that an HR department can fire someone based on community allegations that they have a past history of assault. (Being alleged to have harmed a person is simply not a protected class.)  Also, there is some level of ‚Äúbut coworkers don‚Äôt know everything‚Äù - true, but if it was a case of EEOC violations, the most likely complaints would be ‚Äúthey‚Äôre lazy, they don‚Äôt show up to work, they‚Äôre high maintenance, they fought with management (verbally).‚Äù   Hitting a person is not a likely charge made against the person who is garden-variety being dismissed.  The fact that these are second-hand allegations should be considered. There is a possibility that it‚Äôs a heard-it-through-the-grapevine situation.   But this was a reason given by multiple sources for why he was FIRED from WORK, from his most previous job held, weeks ago. That‚Äôs serious when putting someone in a management role, since they are acting as the company to employees they oversee.  Having hired this individual, there is no requirement to keep him.  If keeping him, this information could be held as the ‚ÄúStrike 1‚Äù (literally?  Eek.) So any smaller issue could rise as a red-flag and reason to terminate, rather than a ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine - give him space to settle in and commit worse errors.‚Äù  Would you be able to run a background screen now? To move from the rumors into factual evidence that this person has current outstanding charges filed for assault? A post-hire background check is legal: it would require the signature of the employee to be run. Stepping into this management role would be a valid reason to require this background check. (And if the employee refuses, they might offer to voluntarily see themselves to the door and exit employment, to avoid the situation coming up so that their trial date for assault will not be found.)    As a company, you have to protect all your employees, not just this one. So if you proceed with the idea that ‚Äúthis is just a misunderstanding,‚Äù senior management better be spotting the first instance that this is NOT a misunderstanding. This person could sour the workplace, even with behaviors far less than physical assault (being physically angry at subordinates if it was an anger issue, being dismissive of female employees [see, adjective, not noun!], having the rumors of past behavior arrive into your company‚Äôs break room, etc.)  NC is an at-will state: if the situation ever feels too toxic, the company can terminate this new hire from employment at your company.  Do not protect physical abusers over the culture of the overall workplace simply because an error was made that could not have been found out, given the hiring process at the time. The alleged history of the abuse is known to the company, so this employee already starts off in ‚Äúprobation‚Äù essentially, with any in-person evidence of minor similar behaviors happening in this workplace being enough cause to fire.",-2,False,

3451,ok1kav,hb4n43l,"I'll tell you my story. I was put on a PIP despite the fact that I was getting very good reviews from my clients. Infact, the only way I knew was when I overheard my clients talking to my bosses on how good of a job I was doing.  Anyway, my bosses had already developed this impression that I was a non performer anyway; so it didn't really matter what anyone said or what I did. Yes, I did make mistakes here and there, but my work was largely impeccable.   This actually brings me to another issue. Perceptions do matter. You can be the worst non-perfomer but still be treated as royalty based on people's perception about you. I will write more about perception and whatvI learnt on a different post.  So I was put on a six week PIP. Keep in mind I had known for 6 months that it was going to get this point. So I wasn't really surprised, when it was announced.   My attitude was very meh. No panic or anything. This surprised everyone even more. Yes, deep down I was worried about losing a position I had held for 3 years, but I never let it show outwardly, otherwise they would use it as more munition.  So the idea was to be completely unpredictable and unreadable. Basically played my cards close to my chest.  Anyway back to the PIP. PIP meetings were held everywhere whereby I had to show my call logs so they could see who I was calling and messaging everyday.  I also had to account for literally every minute on my work calendar. If I went to the loo. I'd have to put it on the calendar. If there was a gap on my calendar, it was classed as a performance issue.  I honestly came to the conclusion that they were trying to wear me down and break my confidence.  But remember I said, playing cards close to your chest? Through out the PIP period I was busy interviewing for multiple positions. Towards the last weeks of the PIP, I started taking advantage of my accrued annual leave to do interviews.   At this point I really didn't care. If an interview came up, I'd take leave to attend it. If leave was denied, I'd turn into a sick leave and simply supply a doctor's note.  Anyway, one week after the end of the PIP period,  I already had an offer for a new position. Had a major pay hike and it was major upward promotion.  On the day of signing the new contract. I wrote a short and terse resignation letter. I was pretty much asked to leave on the very day. Basically kicked out.  They were attempting to deny me a dignified exit but I had 'won' came out the other side successful. That PIP basically jump started my career. My post PIP job opened up opportunities that I'd never imagined in my wildest dreams. So the PIP was a blessing in disguise.  Cherry on the cake? I recently attended a senior managers meeting and guess who I came across?? the people who put me on a PIP. Their company now works for our firm.  I learnt another lesson here too. Its a small world. Treat people with decency and respect, whether they're a janitor, intern or exec. You never know under what circumstance you will meet them in future.   Anyway, that's my PIP story...",1,False,

A few bits (my xp is Irish/UK HR but it's not an awful long way from corporate ZA based on the amount of ZA folks this ay)  * Pay brackets in most companies fall under HR + management remit, but the actual case for your husband getting a pay rise in 99% of companies lies exclusively with his manager and their manager) - HR are usually distant and your husband is likely just another name on an excel file or HR system unless he has regular, personable interaction with him and even then, the ownership of this decision will rest with his manager. * Tenure in no way confers the guarantee of an interview. Someone can be filtered out of the process immediately based on performance. * Qualifications - again, qualifications can vary and generally form a part of the process only. An excellent performer can lack the formal qualifications but might be able to evidence projects, work, experience etc and a company can exercise discretion here. * The rest on pay generally sounds like how most companies approach pay. Pay ranges/increases can bed in, people brought in from outside can negotiate more upon entry etc and this can lead to disparities well above 5% - again there's no entitlement or obligation here from the company. * Pay increases - managers will point to pay brackets and do very little else until your husband hands in his notice at which point they may take the threat seriously or not, depending on his role and stature in the company.  Few actions to consider - chat to his manager directly; focus on the market rate for the role and have him discuss the projects/impact he has made in financial terms as much as possible. ""Market rate is 5k higher than what I'm on, I've delivered XYZ in the last year which has added ABC sales/savings"" etc.  Comparisons of co-worker salaries tend not to move the dial and if anything, will put the manager on the defensive.  Ultimately if your husband is underpaid and overperforming, he'll find work elsewhere, at his pay value, especially if he can show evidence of CPD in the last 24 months. I know the situation may seem unfair - the relationship between an employee and their immediate boss/manager matters far far more than the formalities and processes a company involves, and if this isn't tight, with great guidance and a feedback loop, the rest of it can be hard to smooth over.  It is well worth a tidy up of linkedin and a few job applications - he'll either score a great job and you'll be delighted, or he'll get great feedback and a new burst of energy and may possible form a breakthrough at work.
