    "# Characterizing the Nature of Online Career Advice Communities\n",

    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of our project is to better understand how online career advice communities on Reddit operate. These communities are popular places to seek advice, especially considering that these questions are often high stakes and personal. By researching these communities, we will be able to learn about advice seeking/giving on the internet as a whole, as well as better understand the problems that the modern-day employee faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "Our research questions are as follows:\n",
    "- What type of career-related questions are most being asked and discussed?\n",
    "- Who is asking these questions? What role does Age, Gender, and Anonymity play in these communities?\n",
    "- What are the qualities of what is considered ‘good’ advice on these subreddits?\n",
    "\n",
    "We feel that these research questions cover the most important factors surrounding our topic, and will give us information that will lead us to make actionable recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "If we are successful, there are several stakeholders who stand to gain from our research. Companies will have a better understanding of where information gaps exist for their employees and be able to find ways to fill those information gaps. As a result, employees will have their needs better addressed by the companies they work for. And finally, Reddit users who frequent advice-giving communities will be able to better identify “good” advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "We decided to collect the submission information from the top 250 posts from r/askHR and r/careerguidance to help us answer the first two research questions. Then we collected the comments from each of these submissions to help us answer the third research question. The code we used to collect the post data is outlined in the rest of this notebook. The code we used to collect the comment data from these posts is in the notebook titled 'CollectRedditComments.ipynb.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Our Deliverables\n",
    "- **Collect_Reddit_Submissions.ipynb** (This notebook): Project outline and submission collection\n",
    "- **CollectRedditComments.ipynb**: Comment collection\n",
    "- **postdata.csv**: CSV file of our submission data (250 submissions from r/askHR and 250 submissions from r/careeradvice)\n",
    "- **askHR_comments.csv** and **careeradvice_comments.csv**: CSV files of our comment data\n",

    "## Reddit Post Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains processes to retrieve Reddit submissions from work advice communities. This will be used to generate a csv file containing submission data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our two subreddits of interest are r/careerguidance and r/askHR. Although we had previously planned to examine more subreddits, we found that collecting the comments of even a small subset of posts would still lead to a large dataset. We collected data on 250 posts from each of these subreddits, as well as the comments associated with each post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a key part of our analysis will involve comments (determining good advice versus bad advice), we selected posts sorted by \"top\" as these posts have a high amount of interactions and comments. These posts were taken from the time period over the last year, so that our analysis can address current concerns of people seeking career advice."

      "1  Our 3rd coworker in less than 2 months quit Friday. I asked him what’s next and he said “the sun and the sky”. The other coworkers also didn’t have a job lined up yet. \\n\\nIt’s interesting because my boss just a couple months ago was threatening to fire me, partially citing that we were fully staffed, and now we’re short staffed and she’s changed her tune with me. I’m also a full time graduate student so if I quit, I’d be just fine between student loans and landing an assistantship/ part time gig. \\n\\nThis great resignation movement seems to be the real deal. Unemployment data is being released on Friday and I’m very curious of the results.\\n\\nThere needs to be a “Great Resignation” flair on this sub lol\\n\\nEdit: since I’ve posted this, another coworker quit… 4 coworkers in just at 3 months now.

      "2  I don't understand what is wrong with me. When I look at my parents, they have been working for decades, of course if they had a choice they wouldn't work, but it's like they just shrug it off and just do what they have to do. Me on the other hand, I am exhausted and don't want to work anymore.\\n\\nBut my problem is that I simply do not understand why I am feeling like this. What's most confusing is that my work situation is something that some people wish they had. I work from home. I don't make a lot of money but enough to pay the bills and have some money left for buying small wants. I just came back from an international 2 week vacation. But yet I spent my entire days daydreaming about having passive income so that I can retire and spend my days doing the things I like. I don't like my job. But I'm already thousands in student loan debt for a masters degree in the same career field that I am working right now. I don't even have the energy or desire to up my salary with a different job following my degree. I just do not feel like working.\\n\\nIs there anybody else who has a \"good\" situation going on and still hate working?                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
      "3  So for the last three months, I took over my boss’s role since he took a 4 month leave. I have been managing everything and 2 days ago, I talked to my boss about getting a raise and promotion. He tried giving me the run around and said he could try for approval in march. I then lied and said I need to know asap if a promotion and raise was possible because if not, I am going to another company that was gonna pay me x amount. He called me today and said hr wants to see the offer letter from the other company before they give me the raise. Can they do that? Should I make a fake document? I am thinking about just leaving now because it seems like they can afford to pay me and promote me, but they just don’t want to do it. I’d be grateful for any advice. Thank you. \\n\\nEdit: Just wanted to update y’all on my situation. I took your advice and told my company that I didn’t feel comfortable sharing that information with them and that it was a verbal agreement. They understood and gave me my raise! To the people lecturing me about lying, I value myself over the company. I wanted/deserved  a raise because not only was I fulfilling my responsibilities but also my boss since he’s been out for several months. But I sincerely appreciate all of our advice and thoughts on this. Thank you so much!!!   \n",
